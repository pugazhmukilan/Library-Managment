# Library Management System

This is a simple Java program for managing a library. It allows users to add books, delete books, search for books, and view the entire library collection.


## Code Structure

The code consists of two classes:

- `Books`: This class represents a book and contains various attributes such as book name, book ID, publisher, and genre. It also includes getter and setter methods for accessing and modifying the book details.

- `Library`: This class represents the library and contains a list of books. It provides methods to add a book, display all books, search for a book by name, and delete a book by ID.

The `LibraryManagment` class serves as the main entry point for the program and handles user interaction through a command-line interface.


## Usage

To run the program, you need to compile and execute the `LibraryManagment` class. The program will then display a menu of operations that can be performed:

1. Book entry: Add a new book to the library by providing its ID, name, publisher, and genre.
2. Delete book: Remove a book from the library by entering its ID.
3. Search book: Find a book in the library by entering its name.
4. View whole library: Display all the books in the library.
5. Exit: Terminate the program.

Simply enter the corresponding number for the operation you want to perform and follow the prompts.

Note: Make sure to have Java installed on your system before running the program.
